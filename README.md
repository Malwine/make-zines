### What is a mini zine?

Mini zines are small 1 page self-made and self-published magazines originated in the punk, feminist and queer movements.
They are a great tool to publish your own topics, enabling you to share your strong ideas and thoughts with other people no matter if too niche or ignored by the mainstream.

### Can I do it?

Everyone can do zines. It is totally ok to make rough and unpolished zines. They don't need to be perfectly layouted.

### What do you need?
- A4 paper
- pens
- cutter or scissors

### Step by step

**Step 1:** Fold your paper 4 times
